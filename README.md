# ECE3405-GreyScale-to-RGB
ECE 3405 Foundations in Machine Learning Project. Greyscale to RGB image transformation using Stanford dogs dataset: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

To use this code, first use the variables at the bottom of preprocessing.py to input the original dog directory (preferably the Stanford dogs dataset). For the output directory, create a separate folder with the specific breed. Next, create a separate folder with the specific breed for the masked images. With these folders, go to main.py and input the directory where the newly cropped images are placed, and the directory where the masks have been placed.
